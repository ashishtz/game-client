      <ul>
        <li>The game is played on a 3x3 grid.</li>
        <li>
          Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) on an empty square.
        </li>
        <li>
          The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally,
          vertically, or diagonally) wins.
        </li>
        <li>
          If all 9 squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game
          ends in a draw.
